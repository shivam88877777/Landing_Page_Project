## Instructions

This is the 2nd project of The front-end web developer nanodegree. The aim of this project is to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## Features

* Dynamically add content to the page. This project builds dynamic navigation menu.
* When a user clicks on a navigation item, the item scrolls to the appropriate section rather than giving the default jump.
* While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport/closest to the top is distinguished from the other sections.
